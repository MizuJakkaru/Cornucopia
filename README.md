## Welcome to Cornucopia for Stardew Valley 1.6

This repo is the hub for the Cornucopia mod suite for Stardew Valley 1.6.

## Spreadsheet
[Informational Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uI14bL1yzDceOXVzhetJ5IeDYcrU0YgvzFUF-yKrxoM/edit?usp=sharing) - Detailed info on all crops, goods, and recipes.

## About
This mod is intended to fully function in SDV 1.6 using Content Patcher. Various components of this mod require or utilize certain frameworks, but the majority of this mod runs natively in 1.6 Content Patcher for the smoothest and most natural user experience.

Though the entire code has been redone from the ground up to use Content Patcher for 1.6 and be handled natively by the game going forward, this mod could not exist without Project Populate Json Assets having been a historical milestone and having taken up the mantle from More Crops Mod and others like it. I hope that Cornucopia can provide to the community in the same way that MCM and PPJA did before it. I never imagined that one insane night sitting around a computer and filling out a dream spreadsheet of crops, artisan goods, and recipes would find its way to inspiring and making the backbone of MCM's and then PPJA's content. It's rewarding to come back to SDV and continue the dream of fleshing out the game with Cornucopia.

Though not a direct port or fork of anything that came before it, we have put a lot of effort into revitalizing the content from the original spreadsheet that PPJA used as its bible to capture a true Stardew Valley essence and expand upon vanilla content. We hope you find a lot of new and old favorites in the crops, flowers, artisan goods, and recipes in these mods.
