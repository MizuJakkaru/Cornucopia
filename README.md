## Welcome to Cornucopia for Stardew Valley 1.6

This is the hub for the Cornucopia mod suite for Stardew Valley 1.6.

## Spreadsheet
[Informational Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uI14bL1yzDceOXVzhetJ5IeDYcrU0YgvzFUF-yKrxoM/edit?usp=sharing) - Detailed info on all crops, goods, and recipes.

## About
This mod is intended to fully function in SDV 1.6 using Content Patcher. Various components of this mod utilize certain frameworks, but the majority of this mod runs natively in Content Patcher 2.0+ for the smoothest and most natural user experience. We prioritize configurability, balance, vanilla aesthetic, and variety.

Though the entire codebase has been redone from the ground up to use Content Patcher, this mod could not exist without Project Populate Json Assets having been a historical milestone in the legacy of More Crops Mod and others like it. I hope that Cornucopia can provide to the community in the same way that MCM and PPJA did before it. I never imagined that one insane night sitting around a computer and filling out a dream spreadsheet of crops, artisan goods, and recipes would eventually find its way to inspiring and making the backbone of MCM's, and later PPJA's, content. It's rewarding to come back to SDV and continue the dream of fleshing out the game with Cornucopia.

We have put a lot of effort into revitalizing the content from the original spreadsheet that inspired PPJA, aiming to capture the true Stardew Valley essence and bring refreshing new content to the game. We hope you find a lot of new and old favorites in the crops, flowers, artisan goods, and recipes in these mods.

## So... What's Included?
Cornucopia is a **collection of mods**, all of which can be used together, or on their own. We're constantly working on new mods and updates to expand what's offered!

**Cornucopia - More Crops** The main mod for crops and fruit trees. Here you'll find **fruits, vegetables, berry bushes, plantable mushrooms,** as well as **a couple wild trees and forage items**.

**Cornucopia - More Flowers** A large crop and fruit tree expansion mod based primarily around **decorative flowers**. You'll find some beautiful blooms for honey, not to mention gorgeous hedges and trees to decorate with!

**Cornucopia - Artisan Machines** \(Not published yet\) An expansion for the types of artisan goods you can make. Long gone are the days of min-maxing with ancient fruit wine! Now you can create butters and nut milks, dried herbs or flowers, smoke your fishing haul, and make many more unique goods!
*Some sets of artisan goods, such as alcohols, coffee/teas, soap-making, and ice cream are being separated out into their own mods, to allow for players who are looking for a specific aesthetic. Those will be coming at a later date!
