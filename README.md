This is the hub for the Cornucopia mod suite for Stardew Valley 1.6.

## Spreadsheet
[Informational Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uI14bL1yzDceOXVzhetJ5IeDYcrU0YgvzFUF-yKrxoM/edit?usp=sharing) - Detailed info on all crops, goods, and recipes.

## About
This mod is intended to fully function in SDV 1.6 using Content Patcher. Various components of this mod utilize certain frameworks, but the majority of this mod runs natively in Content Patcher 2.0+ for the smoothest and most natural user experience. We prioritize configurability, balance, vanilla aesthetic, and variety.

Though the entire codebase has been redone from the ground up to use Content Patcher, this mod could not exist without Project Populate Json Assets having been a historical milestone in the legacy of More Crops Mod and others like it. I hope that Cornucopia can provide to the community in the same way that MCM and PPJA did before it. I never imagined that one insane night sitting around a computer and filling out a dream spreadsheet of crops, artisan goods, and recipes would eventually find its way to inspiring and making the backbone of MCM's, and later PPJA's, content. It's rewarding to come back to SDV and continue the dream of fleshing out the game with Cornucopia.

We have put a lot of effort into revitalizing the content from the original spreadsheet that inspired PPJA, aiming to capture the true Stardew Valley essence and bring refreshing new content to the game. We hope you find a lot of new and old favorites in the crops, flowers, artisan goods, and recipes in these mods.

**Cornucopia - Artisan Machines** \(Not published yet\) An expansion for the types of artisan goods you can make. Long gone are the days of min-maxing with ancient fruit wine! Now you can create butters and nut milks, dried herbs or flowers, smoke your fishing haul, and make many more unique goods!
*Some sets of artisan goods, such as alcohols, coffee/teas, soap-making, and ice cream are being separated out into their own mods, to allow for players who are looking for a specific aesthetic. Those will be coming at a later date!*

**Cornucopia - Cooking Recipes** \(Not published yet\) A large expansion of 300+ recipes that utilize vanilla and Cornucopia items! We have iconic dishes from all over the world, ensuring you'll find some foods you know and love.

**Growable Forage and Crop Bushes** Growable Forage is a companion mod made by the Cornucopia team that modifies some of the vanilla crops 

## Configuring Cornucopia
Cornucopia mods are simple to configure with the help of Generic Mod Config Menu (GMCM). We allow you to choose a limited or expanded set of items depending on your specific desire.

**Cornucopia - More Crops**
* "Enable Extended Crops Pack": See image in previous section for included items.
* "Enable Extended Trees Pack": See image in previous section for included items.
* "Enable Herbs Pack": See image in previous section for included items.
* "Category Overrides": Turns some Cornucopia items into the following custom categories: Nut, Mushroom, Herb, Spice. This has no mechanical effect and is purely for visuals. However, it does help identify what items can be used to make what artisan goods (when Artisan Machines mod is released).
* "Vanilla Category Overrides": Turns some vanilla items into the following custom categories: Nut, Mushroom, Herb, Spice. This has no mechanical effect and is purely for visuals.
* "Disable Grape Bushes": When this option is **false**, both White Grape and Grape (vanilla) will act like teabushes (don't need watering, live all year, produce only in fall). If you prefer the crop behavior, set this to **true** and both plants will act like typical crops.

**Cornucopia - More Flowers**
* "Enable Extended Flower Pack": See image in previous section for included items.

**Growable Forage and Crop Bushes**
All options can be set to **true** or **false** to turn them on or off. "Teabush-like" plants act like vanilla teabushes--they don't need watering, should be planted on untilled soil, and survive year-round. Each one has a certain harvest time.
