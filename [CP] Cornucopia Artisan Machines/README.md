## Welcome to Cornucopia - Artisan Valley for Stardew Valley 1.6

This repo is the hub for the Artisan Valley addition to the Cornucopia for Stardew Valley mod pack. It is developed by MizuJakkaru in collaboration with DraconisLeonidas as a spiritual successor to Project Populate Json Assets. It adds over 250 artisan goods to the game and the machines that make them.

## About
This mod is intended to fully function in SDV 1.6 using Content Patcher.

Though the entire code has been redone from the ground up to use Content Patcher for 1.6 and be handled natively by the game going forward, this mod could not exist without PPJA having been a historical milestone and having taken up the mantle from More Crops Mod. I hope that Cornucopia can provide to the community in the same way that MCM and PPJA did before it. I never imagined that one insane night sitting around a computer and filling out a dream spreadsheet of crops, artisan goods, and recipes would find its way to inspiring and making the backbone of MCM's and then PPJA's content. It's rewarding to come back to SDV and continue the dream of fleshing out the game with Cornucopia.

I hope that people also find enjoyment in the updated sprites of Cornucopia. All produce, crops, flowers, and artisan goods are now credited to MizuJakkaru. Should this mod ever stop being supported, a spiritual successor of it can continue using the art assets under insertlicensehere.
