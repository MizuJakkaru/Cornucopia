I first heard of it from a market stall, where the vendor laughed as he handed me a plate. “You'll see,” he said, “one man, a thousand flavors.” And he wasn't wrong. A thousand small fish fried to crispy perfection in a spicy coating such that you could eat them by the spoonful. And oh boy, will you eat them by the spoonful...",
	"Radio_PanikiStew": "Paniki Stew! I stumbled upon this in the high mountains of the tropics, where the smoke from clay stoves mingled with the scent of lemongrass and chilies. Though a gamey meat, the fruit bat's diet imparts an interestingly sweet flavor when cooked, brought out by the rich, spiced coconut milk broth. Don't turn your nose up, and give this dish a go with...",
	"Radio_Blini": "Blini! Blini are delicate, tender pancakes, made with a slightly sweet, yeasted batter that puffs gently in the pan. The buckwheat flour in this recipe adds a lovely nutty depth. Top them with sour cream or cream cheese, and for a real pinkies up moment, fresh caviar. Let's make our batter and preheat our pan...",
	"Radio_BlackenedFish": "Blackened Fish! This fish isn't shy. This fish is a fish which knows how to *sing*. Coated in a bold blend of paprika, cayenne, garlic, thyme, oregano, and a little black pepper, then seared in a *blistering hot* cast-iron pan. Hear that? That's the fish singing! The spices crisp up on the outside while the fish stays light and flakey in a combination that is just... mmwah!...",
	"Radio_SeafoodPaella": "Seafood Paella! This here is a special request from a longtime listener by the name of Gus, who tried my paella once and simply could not get enough. Once you make it too, you'll see why! Rice infused with a rich seafood stock, and saffron to give it that warm golden glow. And then, a crispy caramelized layer of treasure hiding beneath the golden surface... This is celebration in a pan!...",
	"Radio_Bannock": "Bannock! I remember first tasting this in a small camp on the plains, sitting by a fire as the sun slipped behind the hills, the air full of smoke, stories, and laughter. This humble bread carries the history of countless communities, each with their own way of making it. Start by making a dough of flour and water...",
	"Radio_VegetableKorma": "Vegetable Korma! Tender vegetables like carrots, potatoes, or cauliflower are simmered in a rich curry made from yogurt. There are so many different spins on this particular curry, that the recipe ends up just being and expression of *you* in the end! Coarsely chop your favorite vegetables...",
	"Radio_Bibimbap": "Bibimbap! Bibimbap literally means “mixed rice,” but it’s so much more than just rice. There’s a little bit of everything: crisp, sautéed vegetables, tender sprouts, earthy mushrooms, juicy zucchini, and a perfectly fried sunny-side-up egg perched on top, ready to mingle with the other flavors. And don't forget the gochujang! Rinse rice and...",
	"Radio_OdenHotpot": "Oden Hotpot! For me, oden is a dish that brings back fond memories of my travels abroad. I remember walking through the streets on a cold winter evening, and the smell of the savory broth wafting through the air drew me to a street vendor selling oden. I ordered a bowl and was instantly hooked by the heartiness and warmth of the dish...",
	"Radio_Fufu": "Fufu! You'll certainly get a workout pounding this cassava into an elastic and filling dough. It’s always eaten with your hands, often dipped into richly flavored soups or stews carrying bold, spicy, and savory flavors. When making fufu, you'll need to be sure to properly prepare the cassava to remove any toxins, so grab a bowl of water...",
	"Radio_MisoRamen": "Miso Ramen! Ohh... a nice hot bowl of miso ramen! The broth is rich and hearty, fermented miso giving it that signature umami depth. Of course, we'll be finishing it with a melty-gooey egg and leafy veggies, but the real star here is the broth, and you should never overpower it with a pile of toppings! We'll start with our broth today by...",
	"Radio_NasiGoreng": "Nasi Goreng! Imagine a perfect pile of fried rice glistening, flecked with vibrant bits of vegetables, perhaps some cuts of tender chicken, and a fried egg on top, yolk just begging to break and run through the dish. Nasi goreng is the king of flavor and of fried rice! Though there are so many variants of fried rice, none compare to nasi goreng made on an open flame with a large wok. Take day old rice to begin and...",
	"Radio_Laghman": "Laghman! Thick, hand-pulled noodles serve as the base, with fresh eggplant refusing to play second fiddle to the pepper it shares the bowl with.

	"Radio_Inarizushi": "Inarizushi! A type of sushi that's made with saké seasoned rice stuffed inside a sweet and crispy pouch made of deep-fried tofu. A deeply traditional food that's thought to be the favorite of certain regional harvest goddesses. It's a unique and delicious dish that's great to make ahead of time and pack for a picnic or lunch. Start with rice...",
	"Radio_Namul": "Namul! Namul is not so much a dish on its own, as it is a collection of sensations best had in small bites. Lightly blanched or sautéed greens such as spinach, fernbrake, or bean sprouts, tossed with sesame oil, garlic, sesame seeds, and a splash of soy. A hint of chili, a dash of bean paste; no two namul presentations are the same...",
	"Radio_Lutefisk": "Lutefisk! This ages-old preserved fish dish is served aside potatoes and peas to make a wonderfully filling meal for the dead of winter. Of course, homemade lutefisk is the best, but if you don't have the time to soak a fish in lye for two weeks, then store bought is fine. Just be sure to warn your housemates, neighbors, and neighbor's neighbors...",
	"Radio_Ceviche": "Ceviche! A seafood dish made with raw fish that's been marinated in citrus juices, herbs, and spices. The acid from the citrus juices actually 'cooks' the fish, giving it a slightly firm texture and a tangy flavor. There's nothing quite like the blend of tart lime infused fish, crunchy onion, and creamy avocado. Let's get chopping...",
	"Radio_LechedeLeon": "Leche de Leon! Listeners who tuned in last week will remember our recipe for ceviche... but did you know you can also use the same ingredients to make a refreshing, spicy, fishy drink? Don't knock it till you try it! The most important ingredient is a large, freshly-caught lionfish...",
	"Radio_Mohinga": "Mohinga! Rich, fragrant catfish soup garnished with fresh shallots and a squeeze of lime to brighten it up. The base is a tangy fish broth, often thickened with ground rice, and spiced with turmeric, ginger, and a touch of chili. I just can't get enough of this dish, it tastes like a bowl of a home I've never known! Let's start by making the broth...",
	"Radio_Zarusoba": "Zarusoba! A cold noodle dish that's perfect for spring, which consists of soba - or buckwheat - noodles, and a savory dipping sauce. The green onions and ginger add a fresh and slightly spicy kick, while the wasabi adds a unique heat that lingers on the tongue. Let's begin...",
	"Radio_LotusWrappedStickyRice": "Lotus Wrapped Sticky Rice! This wonderful parcel of chewy rice and savory mushrooms has such an addicting fragrance from the lotus leaves used to wrap it.

	"Radio_GreenFigandSaltfish": "Green Fig and Saltfish!  From sun-soaked beaches where steel drums ring lightly in the background, green fig and saltfish is a celebration of contrast. Dried and salted cod balances perfectly with the sweet but unripe plantain. Seasoned to perfection with garlic, it's a burst of flavor. Start by prepping your lingcod...",
	"Radio_FishAmok": "Fish Amok! This curry is a delight for the senses. The aroma of lemongrass and coconut milk wafts through the air, enticing you to take a bite. The creamy texture of the coconut milk and the soft, tender chunks of fish make for a comforting and satisfying meal. First, we'll need to prepare a banana leaf basket...",

	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Caroline.2b": "Is it basil?",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Gus.3a": "Correct!",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Gus.3b": "The main ingredients in pesto are actually pine nuts and basil!",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Gus.3c": "Garlic, oil, and cheese also make it a unique condiment or topping.",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Gus.3d": "It's great on bread and pastas.",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Harvey.4a": "Pine nuts are exceptionally healthy!",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Harvey.4b": "Consuming too many can lead to experiencing a metallic aftertaste, though. It can last for several weeks.",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Demetrius.5a": "What?!",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Demetrius.5b": "That sounds terrible!",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Harvey.6a": "It's... exceedingly uncommon...",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Gus.7a": "*Ahem!*",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Harvey.8a": "Sorry, Gus! Please continue!",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Gus.9a": "Let's get started making some pesto!",
	"Events_GarlicPesto_dialogue.Gus.9b": "First, we’ll start with some fresh pine nuts... This is going to taste so good on some spinach linguini later!",

	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Gus.4d": "I thought today we'd discuss spices and herbs that really up the level of your cooking game: cumin and coriander.",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Gus.4e": "Cumin and coriander are both spices derived from the seeds of their respective plants.",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Jas.5a": "Some of these aren't seeds. These leaves say, um... C-I-L-A-N-T-R-O...",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Jas.5b": "Cilantro?",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Gus.6a": "Good eye, Jas! You sounded out that word beautifully!",

	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Marnie.7a": "What do you use them in? I've got both of them on my spice rack, but I don't think I've ever cracked them open...",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Gus.8a": "Since cumin brings a warm feeling to cooking, it's great in things you want to add a lot of depth to.",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Gus.8b": "Some things just don't taste right without cumin, like the enchilada recipe I've included today.",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Shane.9a": "Does it make things spicier?",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Gus.10a": "Not on its own, but it does add a lot of robust flavor to things.",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Gus.10b": "Coriander or cilantro is also used in things like salsa, though. It gives it that lemony or fresh zest!",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Shane.11a": "Mmm... chips and spicy, spicy salsa!",
	"Events_CilantroCumin_dialogue.Gus.12a": "Let's cover how much and how to use them best!",

	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.3c": "That means the first time for everyone else, welcome!",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.3d": "Today I'm going to cover the wonderful world of tahini!",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.3e": "It can be used in so, so many ways. I'm sure some of you have favorites without even knowing it.",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.3f": "It's used in hummus, baba ghanoush, halva and nougat... or as a dip on its own for falafel and shawarma!",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Elliott.4a": "Hmm... just that list alone takes me away to tales of the Calico Desert lost to the past, or to a bustling far away bazaar.",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.5a": "Tahini is wonderful, bringing out the natural sweetness of the sesame seeds it's made from.",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Leah.6a": "I love hummus!",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Leah.6b": "What is baba ganoush, though? I've never heard of that one.",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.7a": "It's similar!",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.7b": "It uses roasted eggplants and has a wonderfully rich and savory flavor, with a hint of sweetness from the tahini.",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Leah.8a": "Ooh! Eggplants are delicious!",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Evelyn.9a": "Gus, dearie, you mentioned nougat. Is it often used in desserts?",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.10a": "Oh absolutely!",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.10b": "It can be used to flavor cookies, cakes, ice cream... the possibilities are endless!",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.10c": "How about we make something sweet and something savory today?",
	"Events_Tahini_dialogue.Gus.10d": "Let's get started with some sesame seeds and a mortar and pestle...",

	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.AnswerChoice.4a": "It came from the other room.",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.AnswerChoice.4b": "Maybe it was Gus?",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.AnswerChoice.4c": "We should go check it out.",

	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Penny.7a": "Are you sure that's all that's wrong? You seem a little down.",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Gus.8a": "Well... I'm a little worried people haven't been really enjoying the lessons.",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Gus.8b": "You and @ are the only folks who have come through more than once!",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Gus.8c": "Maybe things are a little too detailed or not detailed enough. It can be hard without getting consistent feedback...",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Penny.9a": "Oh, Gus... I'm so sorry...",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Penny.9b": "As a teacher, I know it can feel thankless sometimes.",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Penny.9c": "I do think people have been benefitting from your effort, though.",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Penny.9d": "I'm sure if you ask after people when they come in, you'll hear lots of good things.",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Penny.9e": "What do you think, @?",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.AnswerChoice.10a": "I think the lessons have been fun.",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.AnswerChoice.10b": "You've really added a lot of flavor!",

	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Gus.11b": "...Thank you!",
	"Events_SpiceToTaste_dialogue.Gus.11c": "We should probably get ready for whoever comes today.",
