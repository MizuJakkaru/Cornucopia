## Artists
We hope that people also find enjoyment in the updated sprites of Cornucopia. Everything is being done with a strong drive to capture the game's original spirit. Anything not done by MizuJakkaru or 6480 has been edited from licensed/paid assets from the info below. You may not redistribute assets credited to these artists (Check the Informational Spreadsheet for credit info). Currently, only **Cornucopia - More Recipes** includes outsourced assets.

Paid Assets Artists: [anarchisedlute](https://anarchisedlute.itch.io/), [artoftic](https://artoftic.itch.io/), [cyangmou](https://cyangmou.itch.io/), [pixeltier](https://pixeltier.itch.io/)

## Permissions
The following permissions apply to original Cornucopia assets, as in, any art created by MizuJakkaru or 6480. This includes all art for More Crops, More Flowers, Growable Forage, More Artisan Goods, and some art from More Recipes (Check the Informational Spreadsheet for credit info).

* You may edit and use original Cornucopia assets for any Stardew Valley mod, with credit and a link given to Cornucopia or the artist themselves (MizuJakkaru or 6480).
* You do not need to obtain permission to edit or use original Cornucopia assets.
* You may use Cornucopia assets in mods with Donation Points (or equivalent donation features) enabled.
* You may **not** use Cornucopia assets in mods or games that must be purchased, or are an exclusive reward for people giving some kind of monetary fee (for example, Patreon-exclusive mods). (Patreon-exclusive beta versions are generally okay but should be discussed with us.)
* You may **not** use original Cornucopia assets for games, mods, and other projects that are not affiliated with Stardew Valley, unless you obtain explicit permission from us.

Additionally, the following permissions apply for Cornucopia content:
* You may create any mods listing Cornucopia as a dependency, or including optional features for Cornucopia integration (for example, adding our items to custom stores, or creating unique artisan goods based on our art and produce).
* You may use Cornucopia assets and code to include copies of Cornucopia items in other mods (for example, if you want Cornucopia_Tofu to be obtainable in your NPC mod regardless of if the player has Cornucopia installed). If your mod contains large portions of Cornucopia content, we may ask you to rewrite it to use Cornucopia as a dependency.
* You may **not** reupload, redistribute, or recreate existing mods using our assets and code in a non-transformative way (i.e. without significantly changing or adding new features), excepting updates (see below.) We are happy to discuss uploading official versions to other mod hosting sites (such as Naver).
* You may **not** upload translated copies of Cornucopia. Translations must be submitted to us directly (please reach out if this is an issue for any reason).
* Cornucopia updates will be handled by the Cornucopia team. However, in the case that the Cornucopia team is fully inactive, or the project has been abandoned for whatever reason, you may create unofficial updates and post them in the comments of the relevant mods.
* You may **not** upload updated versions of Cornucopia to Nexus without first contacting us for permission, or if we are entirely unreachable.
* You **must** exhaust all reasonable methods of reaching us (Nexus, the public Stardew Valley discord, Twitter, etc) before considering us unreachable. Reaching out to one team member on Nexus without a response is not sufficient grounds. See Team Members for contact information.
