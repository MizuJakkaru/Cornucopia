## Artists
We hope that people also find enjoyment in the updated sprites of Cornucopia. Everything is being done with a strong drive to capture the game's original spirit. Anything not done by MizuJakkaru or 6480 has been edited from licensed/paid assets from the info below. Provided a sprite does not list a paid asset artist below on the mod's informational spreadsheet, the following rules apply to Cornucopia's art assets:

* Anyone can edit and use for any SDV mod, without permission, with credit.
* Can't use it to recreate an existing mod.
* Can use it for mods with donations enabled.
